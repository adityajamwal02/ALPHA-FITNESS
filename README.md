activities of our website. The information management provided by the
system has a great advantage to reduce records errors associated with
merchandise shop of our branch. The system is handling all aspects of
the inventory control function. It allows the Administrator, delete and
modify the current items in the shop as well as include new items
through queries in database.
Furthermore, the system will make the process of signing up and logging
in/out convenient than any before. On other hand, our project displays
various different means to promote one’s health both physically and
mentally. Keeping detailed records of customers who have enrolled in
our membership programs and subsequently updating the admin
